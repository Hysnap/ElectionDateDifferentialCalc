## Acknowledgement

_This was created whilst learning Python and Data Analysis at the Code Instute on a West Midlands Combined Authority funded course_

This module was created as part of free project looking into Political Party donations in the UK.  In order to push myself further I decided to turn it into a resuable callable module and make it available to all.
